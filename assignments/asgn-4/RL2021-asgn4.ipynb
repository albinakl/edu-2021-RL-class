    "The last assignment is devoted to the deep Critic, MPC and RQL in application to the wheeled robot control in the presence of a disturbance.\n",

    "# Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment we will use the following disturbance model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathrm d Q_t = - \\frac{1}{\\tau_{disturb}} \\left( Q_t \\mathrm d t + \\sigma_{disturb} ( \\mathrm d B_t + \\mu_{disturb}) \\right)$, where\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\tau_{disturb}$ is the time constant, $\\sigma_{disturb}$ is the standard deviation, and $\\mu_{disturb}$ is the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please, familiarize yourself with the Euler-Maruyama method (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler–Maruyama_method), which is an extension of the Euler method to the stochastic case.\n",

    "In contrast to the previous assignments, this one is supposed to be done in .py files of `rcognita` - a framework for robot control, that is under development in the laboratory. So, if this assignment is on your local machine, please execute the following terminal commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `git submodule init`\n",
    "* `git submodule update`\n",
    "\n",
    "Examine the files and folders structure. The `presets` folder consists of the main files, containing high-level experiment descriptions. The ones that are of our interest are moved to the root folder: `main_3wrobot_NI_edu1.py`, `main_3wrobot_NI_edu2.py`, `main_3wrobot_NI_edu3.py`. For convinience the code snippet class (`CtrlOptPredRL`) that is supposed to be complemented is in the same file on the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "This time the results of the code execution are saved in .csv files in `simdata` folder in `rcognita`. Please upload three log files al far as three scripts via https://forms.gle/W1afcQq5QWJWEeDs8.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is to complete the following code snippets in `CtrlOptPredRL` class (in three aforementioned files respectively):\n",
    "* Problem 4.1 - NN critic, critic cost (10 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "In `main_3wrobot_NI_edu1.py` replace a default critic with a NN in `_critic` (which is pretty much alike to the similar task in asgn3). Implement `_critic_cost`, following the pseudocode above.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Problem 4.2 - system output prediction in MPC (10 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement system output prediction (in case `if not self.is_est_model`) with the help of the Euler-Maruyama method in `_actor_cost` for MPC. You are supposed to modify the current version of output prediction, including wrapping it in a loop to calculate mean and introducing stochastic part in the Euler method.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Problem 4.3 - RQL (10 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy `critic_cost` from the first problem into the third snippet and supplement the `RQL` with the Euler-Maruyama system output prediction."
