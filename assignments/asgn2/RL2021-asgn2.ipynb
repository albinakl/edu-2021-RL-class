Please familiarize yourself with the environment (using the links given above) well enough to understand the exact way in which the negative feedback in the first policy stabilizes the pendulum.\n",

    "* When the surrounding of the higher equilibrium is reached, the policy should stabilize the pendulum\n",
    "* It is enough to set negative feedback by the angular velocity for stabilization in the lower equilibrium. However, stabilization in the higher one requires an additional negative feedback term by coordinate: without it the pendulum will slowly move away from the desired position.\n",

    "* Set a condition for switching between stabilizing and destabilizing modes for the policy. It could be angle, measured from the desired position (note that it is not in the observation vector, it should be calculated), height of the center of mass, etc.\n",
